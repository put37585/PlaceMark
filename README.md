# PlaceMark

PlaceMark is a application that lets you manage all the nice places you have been to.

## About
This is part of an assignmet for the course 'Advanced Full Stack Web Development' (KASD) by Eamonn de Leastar.

University: Ostbayrische Technische Hochschule Regensburg

The project is split in to two parts:
1. The backend with an API for creating categories and points of interests. You can find the repository [here]( https://github.com/put37585/PlaceMark). You may also try it your self
[here](https://placemark-ksda.herokuapp.com).

2. A more dynamic frontend using svelte. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/put37585/PlaceMark_svelte). You may also try it your self
[here](https://placemark-kasd.netlify.app).
Additional information around the subprojects can be found on the corresponding GitHub page.


## Description

Even though this part of the project features a small GUI it is more about the backend.
The focus is mainly the API. \
\
**But in short:** 
You can create categories for your points of interests. Then add some points to a category. After adding a title, a description and coordinates you can upload multiple images.\
Additional a admin user can delete other users.\
\
All those features are also depicted in the API. A full documentation for the API can be found [here](https://placemark-ksda.herokuapp.com/documentation).

## Project Status
Overall most features where implemented.\
Mostly the UI needs some improvements. I know it does not look fancy, but the project is more about functionality.

## Deployment
The project is hosted on [heroku](https://heroku.com).\
Images are stored at [cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com).\
All other data is stored on [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com).
